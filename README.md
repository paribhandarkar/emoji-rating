# Emoji Rating

This project is a simple feedback form that allows users to rate a product or service on a scale of 1 to 5 stars. It is a web page built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it includes a form where users can input their feedback and a star rating system that allows users to select the number of stars they wish to give. The stars are interactive, meaning that they change color when clicked on, and the selected number of stars is displayed below the star rating system. The project is a great example of how to build an interactive rating system using basic web development tools.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## New Things I Learned

Learned how to properly use forEach method and how this project uses the forEach method to loop over elements in an array and attach event listeners, as well as to update the appearance of the star elements based on user interaction.

## Challenges I faced

I had some challenges while working on this project. Specifically, I had some questions about how certain parts of the code worked. In particular, I had questions about the arguments used in the forEach loop and how to properly use it. I also had questions about the updateRating function and how it was changing the active state of the star icons. Overall, I was able to overcome these challenges and learn more about how to use these JavaScript features effectively in my projects.
